				<li><b> Synopsis </b></li>
					<b>CAREER: Improving Mobile Video Delivery for Emerging Contents and Networks (NSF Award 1915122) </b> <br />
				Streaming videos wirelessly on mobile devices is an increasingly important application. 
				The objective of this project is to bring innovations to mobile video delivery for new content types and over emerging networks. 
				Specifically, the project investigates three aspects: (1) 360-degree immersive video delivery, 
				(2) video streaming over multiple network paths (multipath), and (3) video streaming over millimeter-wave (mmWave) links. 
				These are expected to be the key building blocks of next-generation video streaming services. 
				First, 360-degree videos provide users with unique panoramic viewing experience; 
				however, 360-degree video content delivery is much more challenging compared to regular videos. 
				Second, multiple network interfaces have become a norm on off-the-shelf mobile devices but their potential is far from being fully exploited. 
				Third, mmWave is a key technology that will be integrated into 5G wireless networks; 
				but adapting video streaming to mmWave largely remains an uncharted territory. 
				The proposed solutions will benefit the society by enhancing the user experience and reducing the resource consumption for next-generation immersive video services. 
				The research will also be integrated with an education plan that seeks to prepare computer science students with the knowledge of new technological trends in networking and systems, 
				and stimulate the general public interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.

				(1) <b>User Head Movement Traces of 360 Videos</b> <br />
				The dataset consists of 5 users' head movement traces when watching 4 360-degree videos. The data was collected by us, and used in our <a href="paper/360video_allthingscellular16.pdf">All Things Cellular paper</a>. <a href="nsf_career/atc16_data.zip">[Download Dataset, 9.8MB]</a> <br />
				
				(2) <b> LIME Measurement Data </b> (coming soon) <br />
				The dataset consists of the viewing statistics of 548 paid Amazon Mechanical Turk viewers from 35 countries who have watched more than 4,000 minutes of 360-degree live videos. The data was analyzed in our <a href="paper/lime_mmsys19.pdf">MMSys 2019 paper</a>. 	<br />
				
				(3) <b> 5G Measurement Data </b> <br />
				We release the data collected by us in the WWW20 paper. This data is important in providing a first impression of the world's very first commercial 5G rollouts, and serves as an important baseline of 5G performance. We conduct several experiments to evaluate 5G performance, including but not limited to throughput performance, latency measurements, impact of mobility and obstructions, handoff analysis among many others. Our experiments also illustrate the pros and cons of the different 5G technologies. <a href="https://fivegophers.umn.edu/www20/">[Goto download page]</a> <br />
				
				(4) <b> Lumos5G Data </b> <br />
				We release the data collected by us in the IMC20 paper. The emerging 5G services offer numerous new opportunities for networked applications. In this study, we seek to answer two key questions: (i) is the throughput of mmWave 5G  predictable, and (ii) can we build "good" machine learning models for 5G throughput prediction? To this end, we conduct a measurement study of commercial mmWave 5G services in a major U.S. city, focusing on the throughput as perceived by applications running on user equipment (UE). Through extensive experiments and statistical analysis, we identify key UE-side factors that affect 5G performance and quantify to what extent the 5G throughput can be predicted. We then propose Lumos5G -- a composable machine learning (ML) framework that judiciously considers features and their combinations, and apply state-of-the-art ML techniques for making context-aware 5G throughput predictions. Our work can be viewed as a feasibility study for building what we envisage as a dynamic 5G throughput map (akin to Google traffic map) that serves as a fundamental building block for future 5G-aware apps. <a href="https://lumos5g.umn.edu/">[Goto download page]</a> <br />
